# aima-exercises
My solutions to the exercises in "Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach, 3rd Edition".
The solutions are organized in chapters.

## Conventions ##
Each chapter has a directory containing:
* A README file with the answers to the open ended questions.
* A src directory with code in Java for the programming questions.
  * Each Java Class solves one question.
  * Each Java class begins with a comment explaining the solution approach.
  
## Notes (TODO: find a better name for this section) ##
This repository and it's structure are inspired by @JKCooper2 's [repository](https://github.com/JKCooper2/ai-ama-exercises).
